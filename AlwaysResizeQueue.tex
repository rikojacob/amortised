\begin{abstract}
  This note analyzes the implementation AlwaysResizeQueue.java,
  a FIFO queue that avoids wrap around by always creating a new array of twice the current size when the end of the current array is reached.

\begin{quote}
  {\bf Proposition 1.} In the Always Resize Queue implementation, all operations take amortized constant time, beginning from an initialized data structure.
\end{quote}

We use the localised piggy bank argument with the additional property that we can read of the number of available coins from the current state of the data structure.
This is also known as the potential method, where the potential of the data structure is the number of coins available in a certain state.

We use the variable $n = \texttt{last} - \texttt{first}$ for the current size of the data structure.

We observe that the data structure maintains the invariant $\texttt{last} \geq \texttt{q.length/2}$. 
\begin{quote}
  {\bf Potential.} The data structure has $\texttt{first} + 2(\texttt{last} - \texttt{q.length}/2)$ coins in the piggy bank.
  One coin allows to copy 2 elements and create 4 slots in an array, i.e. stands for constant time.
\end{quote}

Observe that the actual cost of resize is $n$ copy operations and creating an array of $2n+2$ elements, i.e., $n$ coins.
After the resize operation, there are no coins in the piggy bank.

It remains to show that the all operations of the interface (not \texttt{resize}) take amortized constant time.
This is obvious as long as resize is not called, so it suffices to consider
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{enqueue}]
  Without resize, there is constant work and two coins need to be paid.
  A resize happens by reaching the end of the array, we have $\texttt{last} - \texttt{q.length}/2 = \texttt{q.length}/2 \ge n/2$.
  Hence, there are at least $n$ coins available to pay for the resize.
\item[\texttt{dequeue}]
  Without resize, there is constant work and 1 coin to be paid.
  A resize happens if
  \[ \texttt{last} - \texttt{first} < \texttt{q.length/4} \]
  which, together with the invariant, implies $\texttt{first} \ge \texttt{q.length/4}$.
  Hence, the coins from \texttt{first} can pay at least for the elements in positions 
  $\texttt{q.length/4}\ldots \texttt{q.length/2}$, while the coins from \texttt{last} can pay for the positions   $\texttt{q.length/2}\ldots \texttt{last}$.

  \pagebreak
  We can also just do the calculus:
  \[ \texttt{q.length/4} > \texttt{last} - \texttt{first} \ge \texttt{q.length/2} - \texttt{first} \]
  \[  \texttt{first} >  \texttt{q.length/4} \]
  \[  \texttt{q.length/2} - \texttt{first} <  \texttt{q.length/4} < \texttt{first} \]
  \[ n = \texttt{last} - \texttt{first} = (\texttt{last} -\texttt{q.length/2}) + (\texttt{q.length/2} - \texttt{first}) \le  2(\texttt{last} - \texttt{q.length}/2) + \texttt{first}  \]
  
\end{description}
